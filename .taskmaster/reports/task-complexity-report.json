			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Budgeting Tools",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Implement Core Budgeting Tools' task into 5 subtasks. The breakdown should cover backend database schema and logic for budget calculations, API endpoint creation for budget management, frontend UI development for setting up budgets, frontend UI for displaying budget progress on the dashboard, and the final integration to connect the frontend components with the backend data.",
			"reasoning": "The task is complex as it involves both significant frontend UI/UX work for creating and visualizing budgets, and crucial backend logic for aggregating transaction data. It requires database schema updates, potentially complex SQL queries or functions, and new API endpoints. The integration with the existing transaction system adds another layer of complexity."

			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Build Custom Go Backend API for Advanced Logic",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Build Custom Go Backend API' task into 5 subtasks. The breakdown should focus on creating a secure and robust service, including implementing JWT authentication middleware, setting up the database connection layer, developing the core business logic for the initial report generation, creating the public-facing API endpoint, and establishing a comprehensive testing suite.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity because it involves creating a new backend service from scratch, which includes critical architectural decisions. Implementing secure authentication middleware, establishing robust database interaction patterns, and writing complex data aggregation logic are all non-trivial efforts that will set the standard for future backend development."

			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Goal Setting and Tracking Feature",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Implement Goal Setting and Tracking Feature' task into 4 subtasks. The breakdown should include creating the backend API for goal management, developing the frontend UI for creating and editing goals, designing the visual component to track progress, and integrating the frontend with the backend API.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is medium-low. While it involves a full-stack feature slice (UI, API, visualization), the underlying business logic is simple CRUD and basic arithmetic. It leverages existing patterns (PostgREST, frontend components) without introducing new architectural challenges."

		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Real-time Data Sync and Notifications",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Integrate Real-time Data Sync and Notifications' task into 5 subtasks. The breakdown should separate the work into two main streams: real-time data updates and the notification system. Subtasks should cover setting up the Supabase Realtime subscriptions, refactoring frontend components to be dynamic, implementing the backend logic to trigger notifications, building the frontend notification UI, and integrating the end-to-end notification flow.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex because it introduces an event-driven, real-time architecture into a previously request-response-based application. This requires significant changes to frontend state management. Furthermore, implementing a reliable notification system with complex trigger logic (e.g., on budget excess) and a new UI layer adds considerable effort and testing challenges."
