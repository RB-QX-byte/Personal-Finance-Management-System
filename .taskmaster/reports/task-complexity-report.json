		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Initial Project Setup and Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for creating the Supabase project, initializing the Astro.js frontend, initializing the Go backend, and configuring the necessary environment variables and client libraries to connect them all.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves setting up three separate services (frontend, backend, BaaS) and ensuring they can communicate. This requires distinct configuration steps for each service and for their integration, making it moderately complex and suitable for several subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Database Schema in Supabase",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for creating the SQL migration script for each core table: `profiles`, `accounts`, `categories`, `transactions`, and `budgets`. Ensure each subtask includes defining columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any necessary constraints.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires careful data modeling and writing precise SQL migration scripts for multiple interconnected tables. Errors here can be costly later. Breaking it down by table is a natural way to manage this complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Implement User Authentication and Authorization",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for building the frontend authentication UI (sign-up, login), implementing the client-side auth logic with Supabase, creating protected routes, and defining and testing the Row Level Security policies for all user-specific tables.",
			"reasoning": "The task combines frontend UI/logic for authentication with complex backend security rules (RLS). RLS is critical for data security and requires careful implementation and testing for each data table, making this a high-complexity task that benefits from detailed subtask breakdown."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Account Management (CRUD)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for creating the API endpoints (via PostgREST), building the Astro.js form component for creating/editing an account, building the component to list all accounts, and implementing the client-side state management and data fetching logic.",
			"reasoning": "This is a standard full-stack CRUD feature involving both backend API exposure and frontend UI/UX development. It can be broken down into creating the UI for creating/editing, the UI for listing, and the client-side logic that connects them to the API."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Transaction Management (CRUD)",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for building the transaction form UI with account and category selectors, creating the transaction list view, implementing the client-side CRUD logic, and ensuring that creating/editing/deleting a transaction correctly links to the parent account.",
			"reasoning": "This task is another full-stack CRUD feature, but with added complexity from its dependencies on `accounts` and `categories`. The UI form is more complex, and there's a need to handle these relationships correctly on both the frontend and backend."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Budgeting Tools",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for implementing budget CRUD operations, creating the backend logic or database function to aggregate transaction data against a budget, building the UI to display budgets, implementing the progress bar visualization, and testing the complete flow.",
			"reasoning": "This task goes beyond simple CRUD. It requires data aggregation (calculating spending against a budget) and data visualization (progress bars). This involves both backend logic for calculation and frontend work for presentation, making it significantly complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Design and Build Main Dashboard UI",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for creating the main dashboard page route, designing the responsive grid layout, building individual placeholder components for each dashboard widget, and styling the page with Tailwind CSS.",
			"reasoning": "This is a focused UI task. Its complexity lies in creating a responsive and clean layout with placeholders. Breaking it down into creating the page, defining the main layout, creating placeholder components, and ensuring responsiveness is a logical workflow."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Net Worth Tracker Component",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for creating the backend logic (either a PostgreSQL function or a Go API endpoint) to calculate net worth, developing the frontend Astro.js component to display the value, fetching the data for the component, and integrating it into the main dashboard.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves a distinct backend calculation and a frontend display component. It's a good candidate for subtasks that separate the backend logic (creating the calculation function/endpoint) from the frontend work (creating the component and integrating it)."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Real-time Data Updates",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for enabling Realtime on the required Supabase tables, implementing a subscription to the `transactions` table to update the UI, implementing a similar subscription for the `accounts` table, and ensuring proper subscription lifecycle management.",
			"reasoning": "This task introduces asynchronous, event-driven programming. It's complex because it requires managing state reactively and handling the lifecycle of subscriptions. Breaking it down by which data source to make real-time is a good approach."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Goal Setting & Tracking Feature",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for designing and creating the `goals` database table, implementing the API and security rules, building the UI form for creating/editing goals, developing the UI component to display goal progress, and writing the client-side logic to connect everything.",
			"reasoning": "This is a self-contained, full-stack feature. It requires database schema design, API creation, and frontend development for both data entry and visualization. These distinct steps make it well-suited for expansion into multiple subtasks."
